# ExpenseBot
**A smart bot integrated with WhatsApp to manage expenses**

Managing everyday expenses can quickly become overwhelming with the number of transactions we make. To simplify this, we are building a Smart Expense Bot that integrates directly with WhatsApp, eliminating the need to install another app or create new accounts. Just open WhatsApp and start tracking your expenses with ease!

Our bot is built using **Python Flask** for the backend, with **Ngrok** to expose the local server and **Twilio WhatsApp API** for messaging integration.

The bot offers two modes:
**Personal Expense Mode:** Add expenses, view all entries, and visualize category-wise spending using a pie chart.
**Group Expense Mode:** Create groups, add members, track group expenses, and view group-wise spending details.
